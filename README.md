# DayZ Bartering system


## Description
### **DayZ Bartering system is an alternative to countless trading mods**

- #### DayZ has a lot of trading mods, but in reality, would a post apocalyptic world have currency?
- #### The DayZ Bartering system makes the trading more realistic: instead of using currency, you trade items for items.

- ### **Unlimited recipes**: 
  - #### You can choose as many "recipes" as you want, that the player needs to get the final product.
    
- ### **Barter level system**: 
  - #### After every barter, you get one level to your barter level. This level is persistent and is saved to a file.
 
- ### **Sleek UI**: 
  - #### Many mods have a dull looking UI due to the minimalistic Enfusion layout system. Not anymore!
  
- ### **AI Missions**: 
  - #### While the main point of this mod is to add a bartering system, I have also added AI missions:
    - #### Mayor mansion mission, Medical supply mission, Weapons cache mission, Cult mission.
